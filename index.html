    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p> We met when we were just 15 years old, in middle school material science class. We started as friends but it quickly turned into something deeper. Pretty soon every band concert, swim meet, and jump rope compititions were spent together; supporting one another. In high school we ensured that every class we had was together. Living just down the street from eachother allowed us to grow a connection like no other.</p>
    <p> The true test of our love was when Marie went off to college. We were 4,000 miles apart, hours away from one another. We went weeks, even months without seeing eachother. Surprise visits, holidays, long weekends and school breaks are what we started to live for. After we made it through those 4 years we knew we could make it through anything. We are ready to spend everyday for the rest of our lives together.</p>
